            Authentic figures don't lie, statistics serves for a proof. The hidden details of any program or project are 
            better appreciated when facts are paired with figures.
            Yawning figures from impeccable sources on the Nigerian real estate development situation are both 
            intimidating and inciting, they produce an atmosphere of frenzy in which economic opportunities are wrapped 
            with mud that defies the sight and depresses the heart. But the underlying truth from empirical results is 
            that the Nigerian real estate market is ONE OF THE BIGGEST GOLDMINE globally.
            This cannot be an hypothesis for those who understand the following:
            (1). In January 2015, the Nigerian real estate market was valued at #6.4 trillion (USD39bn) at a CAGR of 
            10% ---- CBO Capital.
            (2.). In 2020, property listing enquires surged by over 72% before the pandemic. ---- CBO Capital
            (3). Nigeria has a housing deficit of over 17m at the rate of 4.7% urbanization yearly ----- NIESV Lagos
            (4). There are 24.4million people in Nigeria without a house to live ----- the Borgen Project
            These eloquent statistics is justified by the present heightened level of property development witnessed 
            especially in urban areas and cities across the nation. But while Nigerians are struggling to make sense of 
            these figures, Smash Group has developed a platform tool to help everyone extract wealth from this goldmine.

            On the Smash Technology platform, your investment capital is yours at all times, secure and guaranteed. 
            Wit this system, you help in giving Nigerians affordable housing without spending your time on it,
